mingcjs is a library intended to make processing binary data stored within ArrayBuffers easier and make JS to wasm/asm.js interop 
easier and more efficient. It can also be used with web applications that need reduced memory consumption and can afford
to use smaller packed datatypes like 8/16 bit integers.
